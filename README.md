Here is overview of this project

I've created a Weather App which is a Asynchronous Node.js file here to create this weather app i've used api i.e., "WeatherStack" which is an absolutely free and for Geocoding, now you must be thinking what is geocoding,right so let me explain that Geocoding is the process of transforming a description of a location—such as a pair of coordinates, an address, or a name of a place—to a location on the earth's surface. You can geocode by entering one location description at a time or by providing many of them at once in a table. The resulting locations are output as geographic features with attributes, which can be used for mapping so for Geocoding i've used "Mapbox" API. I've included all the files used in this project. 

I Hope you find this useful! Good Luck!!
